# Next Steps & Project Roadmap

This document captures the remaining tasks and vision for the Pocitaj app. It serves as a backlog for future development sessions.

## 🎨 Audio & Visual Polishing
- **Satisfying Soundscape**: Add missing sound effects for UI interactions, correct/incorrect answers, and milestone achievements.
- **Vibrant Color Palette**: Revitalize the UI with a more playful and colorful aesthetic, moving away from plain beige backgrounds.
- **Playful Moments**: Introduce random success animations (animated GIFs or micro-animations) featuring sushi, cats, and other friendly animals to delight users.

## 🏆 Gamification & Engagement
- **Achievement System**: Define and implement 15+ daily achievements (e.g., "Star Collector," "Morning Bird," "Speed Demon") to reward consistency.
- **Daily Practice Goals**: Rework "Smart Practice" into a tiered daily challenge. Offer clear goals (10, 30, or 50 exercises) that progress toward earning all three sushi rewards in the tracker.
- **"Boss Battle" Review Levels**: Make review levels feel like significant milestones. Use engaging visuals and icons that clearly communicate the purpose and scope of each review (e.g., "Review of levels 1-3").

## 📚 Curriculum & Logic
- **Operand Expansion**: Fill in the gaps in the curriculum by adding missing operand levels for subtraction, multiplication, and division where they make pedagogical sense.
- **Progress Visualization**: Evaluate the multiplication grid in the Progress Report. Decide if it should remain a standalone view or be integrated into the Exercise Setup view for better context.

## 📱 User Experience & Platform
- **Enhanced Profile Editing**: Upgrade the user profile view with a wider selection of nicer icons and implement automatic color assignment for new profiles.
- **Adaptive Layouts**: Ensure a premium experience across all devices by implementing specialized UIs for landscape orientation, foldables, and tablets.
- **Unified Icons**: (From LEARNING_PLAN) Ensure all levels have distinct, high-quality icons that represent their content.

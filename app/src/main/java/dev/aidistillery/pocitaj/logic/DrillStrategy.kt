/**
 * Defines a learning algorithm to master a set of facts (e.g., a multiplication
 * table) using a multi-level mastery system and a dynamic "working set." This
 * strategy prioritizes weaker items and adapts to user performance, making it
 * suitable for short, focused review sessions.
 *
 * The logic is as follows:
 *
 * 1.  **Mastery Levels & Initialization:**
 * All facts begin at Level 1.
 * - **L1 (Learning):** Represents new or incorrectly answered facts that require
 * frequent, immediate review. (Strength 0-2)
 * - **L2 (Consolidating):** Represents facts that have been learned but require
 * spaced review to build long-term memory. (Strength 3-4)
 * - **L3 (Fluent):** Represents mastered facts that require only occasional
 * review to maintain fluency. (Strength 5)
 *
 * 2.  **The Dynamic Working Set (e.g., Target Size = 4):**
 * A review session operates on a small, temporary queue of the weakest facts
 * to keep the user focused.
 * - **Formation:** At the start of a session, the set is populated by pulling
 * facts in a specific priority order until the set is full:
 *   1. All L1 facts (strength 0-2).
 *   2. The most overdue L2 facts (strength 3-4, oldest timestamp first).
 *   3. New, unseen facts to fill any remaining space.
 *   4. Mastered (L3) facts, sorted by oldest timestamp, to fill any remaining space.
 * - **Maintenance:** When a fact is answered correctly and is considered "stable" (strength 4 or 5),
 * it is removed from the working set. The empty slot is then filled by the next-weakest
 * available fact from the entire level, ensuring a constant challenge.
 *
 * 3.  **Promotion Logic:**
 * a) **L1 -> L2 (Encoding):** A fact is promoted after 2 consecutive correct
 * answers within a single review session.
 * b) **L2 -> L3 (Consolidation):** A fact is promoted after being answered
 * correctly in a separate, spaced-out session.
 *
 * 4.  **Error Handling & Demotion:**
 * If a fact is answered incorrectly, it is immediately demoted to strength 0
 * and moved to the back of the working set for immediate repetition.

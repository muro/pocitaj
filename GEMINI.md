# Gemini Project Configuration

# NOTE FOR GEMINI:
# When creating git commit messages, do not use any quotes (single or double)
# or backticks (`). Using them will break the commit message on this platform.
# Also, please always ask before committing to git by showing me the proposed commit message. If I approve the message, you should proceed with the commit.
# When creating commit messages, please don't include every tiny detail. When committing, also do a push.
# When I reply with "LGTM", it means OK or proceed.

# When asked to check the project or run tests, run all unit and android instrumentation
# tests.

# If you are adding depenendencies, please use libs.versions.toml and if the same version
# is used across multiple libraries, use just one version contact with a good name - update the
# name if the use changes. Use names with clarity and consistency. For the version, avoid "version"
# suffix and kebab-style - use caml case.

# When editing any kotlin or java files, please double-check that all imports are at the top of the file.

# After you make changes, please verify that all unit and instrumented tests pass.

# When running tests and attempting to fix failing tests, take into account which tests changed status
# and whether previously failing tests started to pass.
# Consider individual test cases, not just full tests.

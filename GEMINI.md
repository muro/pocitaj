# Gemini Project Configuration

# NOTE FOR GEMINI:
# When creating git commit messages, do not use any quotes (single or double)
# or backticks (`). Using them will break the commit message on this platform.

# When asked to check the project or run tests, run all unit and android instrumentation
# tests.
